## Hi there 👋
### I'm Pranj, a Software Engineering Graduate from the University of Alberta.

### Through my past experiences, I've not only gained hands-on experience in full-stack development, but also thrived in collaborative environments, working effectively with diverse groups of people to achieve common goals.

### I am eager to apply my skills in new and challenging contexts and am interested in projects that leverage software to drive impactful, real-world applications.
